Learning DSA in Python - Syllabus (Estimated Duration: 2-3 Months)
This syllabus provides a roadmap for learning Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) in Python. It's designed for a self-paced learning experience with an estimated duration of 2-3 months, depending on your prior programming experience and the depth you want to achieve.

Week 1-2: Introduction and Basic Data Structures

Concepts: Introduction to DSA, Big O Notation (time and space complexity), problem-solving strategies.
Data Structures: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries, Sets (built-in Python data structures).
Practice: Implement basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching on these data structures.
Resources:
Online Courses: "Python for Everybody Specialization" (Coursera), "Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms using Python" (Udacity)
Books: "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava, "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart
Week 3-4: Stacks and Queues

Concepts: Abstract Data Types (ADTs), Stack (LIFO - Last In First Out) operations (push, pop, peek), Queue (FIFO - First In First Out) operations (enqueue, dequeue).
Implementation: Implement Stacks using Lists and Queues using both Lists and Linked Lists.
Applications: Undo/redo functionality, Expression evaluation, Breadth-First Search (BFS) in graphs.
Resources: Online tutorials and exercises on Stacks and Queues in Python.
Practice: Solve problems involving stacks and queues (e.g., balancing parentheses, reversing a string).
Week 5-6: Linked Lists

Concepts: Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List, Node structure, Traversal (iterative and recursive).
Implementation: Implement Singly and Doubly Linked Lists with basic operations (insert, delete, search).
Applications: Representing sequences where frequent insertions/deletions are needed (e.g., undo/redo functionality).
Resources: Online tutorials and visualizations for understanding Linked Lists.
Practice: Implement and solve problems using Linked Lists (e.g., reversing a Linked List, detecting loops).
Week 7-8: Trees

Concepts: Binary Search Tree (BST), insertion, deletion, searching (in-order, pre-order, post-order traversal).
Implementation: Implement Binary Search Trees with insertion, deletion, and search functionalities.
Applications: Efficient searching (sorted data), symbol tables, maintaining sorted order.
Resources: Online tutorials and visualizations for understanding Binary Search Trees.
Practice: Implement and solve problems using Binary Search Trees (e.g., finding the minimum/maximum element, finding kth smallest element).
Week 9-10: Sorting Algorithms

Concepts: Different sorting algorithms (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort) and their time/space complexities.
Implementation: Implement common sorting algorithms in Python.
Applications: Sorting data for efficient retrieval, searching.
Resources: Online tutorials and visualizations for understanding sorting algorithms.
Practice: Implement and compare different sorting algorithms for efficiency.
Week 11-12: Hashing and Searching

Concepts: Hash functions, Hash Tables (collision resolution techniques).
Implementation: Implement Hash Tables with basic operations (put, get, delete).
Applications: Efficient key-value lookup, password storage (hashed passwords).
Resources: Online tutorials and explanations for Hash Tables and Hashing.
Practice: Implement and solve problems using Hash Tables (e.g., finding duplicate elements in an array, counting frequencies of words).
Week 13-14: Graphs

Concepts: Directed vs. Undirected Graphs, Adjacency List/Matrix representation, Graph Traversal (DFS - Depth-First Search, BFS - Breadth-First Search).
Implementation: Implement Graphs using Adjacency List/Matrix with basic operations (adding edges, removing edges, traversal).
Applications: Modeling networks (social networks, transportation networks), finding shortest paths, topological sorting.
Resources: Online tutorials and visualizations for understanding Graphs.
Practice: Implement and solve problems using Graphs (e.g., finding connected components, detecting cycles).
Week 15-16 (Optional): Advanced Topics

Heaps: Priority queues, implementing heaps (e.g., for finding the minimum/maximum element efficiently).
Tries: Prefix trees for efficient string search and manipulation.
Graphs (Advanced): Shortest path algorithms (Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bellman-Ford Algorithm)
